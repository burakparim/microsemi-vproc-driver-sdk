This directory contains various test application to test Microsemi VPROC Device HBI Driver.

Build Instructions:
------------------

Apps are built as independent executables. User can conditionally compile them on/off using command line TEST options.
Below are the build instructions when building using Gen SDK.

- make apps HBI_HELLO=1-  it will build hbi_hello binary

- make apps HBI_TEST=1-  it will build hbi_test binary

- make apps HBI_LOAD_FIRMWARE=1 - build hbi_load_firmware binary

- make apps HBI_LOAD_GRAMMAR=1 - build hbi_load_grammar binary

Running apps 
------------------
- Run "make apps TARGET=help"  to get help menu
- Executables are built inside apps/ directory. 
- user can run them as "apps/<executable name>
- on certain linux platform, if user not a root then may need  to use "sudo apps/<executable>
  Example to run hbi_test:     
  "sudo apps/hbi_test"

Descriptions:
-------------
hbi_hello.c
- Asimple hello world application based on the SDDK

hbi_test.c 

- Basic HBI Driver testing. Test Include various TEST MACROS that user can enable / disable before compilation.
  If  no TEST MACRO is enabled, then only basic HBI Driver init/open/close/term API will be tested.

hbi_load_firmware.c
- Test Dynamic and static firmware and configuration record loading.

hbi_load_firmware.c
- Test Dynamic ASR grammar loading.

Please refer to docs folder in individual test app for more description on their usage.
