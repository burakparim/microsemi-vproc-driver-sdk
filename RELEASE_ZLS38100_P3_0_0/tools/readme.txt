twConvertFirmware2c.c is a c utility to convert the Timberwolf devices (Zl38040/5x/6x/8x) firmware image (.s3) and config files (.cr2) into a *.h and/or .bin output.

  
This utility gives user a flexibility to generate image with different blocksizes. 16 to 128 WORDS for firmware image and 1-128 for configuration record.
i.e. whole image will be written to device in the block size as mentioned by user in command line arguments.
The supported block size must be computed as per this equation
for firmware block size: 16*2^n, where n can be one these values 0, 1, 2 or 3
for configuration block size: 1*2^n, where n can be one these values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7

Utility is provided as simple c-code compilable on any platform. 
It is compilable over linux using host installed gcc tool or windows based IDE.

for ex. to compile on linux can use gcc twConverFirmware2.c -o  twConvertFirmware2c


Usage: 

*PLEASE NOTE IN EXAMPLE BELOW EXECUTABLE NAME IN FOLLOWING EXAMPLES IS JUST FOR REFERENCE AND THAT MUST BE REPLACED BY 
 NAME AS GENERATED BY USER AFTER THEIR LOCAL HOST COMPILATION PROCESS.

twConvertFirmware2c.exe -i <input file> -o <output file> -b <block_size> -f <firmware code>


Example:

To see usage menu, run
twConvertFirmware2c.exe -h


for generating C-image with block size of 16 words
twConvertFirmware2c.exe -i zl38040_firmware.s3 -o zl38040_firmware.h -b 16 -f zl38040

for creating bin image 
twConvertFirmware2c.exe -i zl38040_firmware.s3 -o zl38040_firmware.bin -b 16 -f zl38040

for converting config record in C-code format
twConvertFirmware2c.exe i zl38040_config.cr -o zl38040_config.h -b 16 -f zl38040

for converting config record in bin format
twConvertFirmware2c.exe i zl38040_config.cr -o zl38040_config.bintw	 -b 16 -f zl38040
